# DEPRECATION NOTICE - 2019/07/31
### This is a *really* old superaction that was originally made in Atlas v7, I do not suggest using it. However I am developing a new economy superaction but I cannot guarantee a definite release date. Join our support server for updates about this.

More commands, mainly ones that allow you to earn money, will be added in the near future.
Please stand by!



* Before running any of these economy commands, you *must* create a role exactly named `üè¶ Account Holder`. If you do not create that role, *none* of the commands will work.



* You must upload the `economy_gem.png` emoji to your guild as well or the formatting will be screwed up. *Do not change the emoji name!*

* If you uploaded the economy gem emoji and the formatting is still screwed up, go to a Discord channel, type `\:economy_gem:`, and replace any `:economy_gem:` in the custom command codes with that code.



* When executing a command with a `<user>` variable in it, you must tag that user. I.E. `@JaMcSu`. *Simply typing `JaMcSu` will not work!*
