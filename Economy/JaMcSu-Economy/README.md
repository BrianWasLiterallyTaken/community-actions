Before running any of these economy commands, you *must* create a role exactly named `üè¶ Account Holder`.
If you do not create that role, *none* of the commands will work.



You must upload the `economy_gem.png` emoji to your guild as well or the formatting will be screwed up.
*Do not change the emoji name!*

If you uploaded the economy gem emoji and the formatting is still screwed up, go to a Discord channel, type `\:economy_gem:`, and replace any `:economy_gem:` in the custom command codes with that code.



When executing a command with a `<user>` variable in it, you must tag that user. I.E. `@JaMcSu`.
Simply typing `JaMcSu` *will not* work!
