# atlas-custom-commands
This repo serves as a way to share custom commands, as well as view examples to create your own.

## Naming conventions
Custom commands should be placed in the folder they apply to the most - i.e faux artificial economy commands in economy, fun-related commands in fun - and must follow the naming "CommandAuthor-CommandName.txt".
