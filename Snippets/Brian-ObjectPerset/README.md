# ObjectPerset
A snippet that can write or modify variables into one perset. In short, it's a collection of multiple and different variables in a perset. Just like an [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) in Javascript, it's a collection of properties with a key and a value.

**Example**

Inside a `fruit_blender` perset
```sh
Apple: 5
Grapes: 6
Pineapple: 2

Blendable: true
```
The example shown above is a small `fruit_blender` perset. It contains the number of each fruits to blend, it also shows if it's blendable or not. So it has **4** total values inside **1** perset.
