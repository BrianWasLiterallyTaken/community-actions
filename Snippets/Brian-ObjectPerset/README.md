# ObjectPerset
A snippet that can write or modify variables into one perset. In short, it's a collection of multiple and different variables in a perset. Just like an [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) in Javascript, it's a collection of properties with a key and a value.

**Examples**

**Inside a __`fruit_blender`__ perset** 
```yaml
Apple: 5
Grapes: 6
Pineapple: 2

Blendable: true
```

**Inside a __`{user.id}.profile`__ perset**
```yaml
Kills: 300
Wins: 69
Loses: 421
Experience: 15326

KDR: 12.5
Winrate: 2.33
