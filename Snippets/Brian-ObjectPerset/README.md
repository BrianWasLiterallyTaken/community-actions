# ObjectPerset
A snippet that can write or modify variables into one perset. In short, it's a collection of multiple and different variables in a perset. Just like an [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) in Javascript, it's an element that you can access to get it's value.

**Example**
The example shown below is an example of a small `fruit_blender` perset. It contains the number of fruits to blend from `Line 1` to `Line 3`, it also shows if it's blendable or not on `Line 5`.
```sh
Apple: 5
Grapes: 6
Pineapple: 2

Blend: true
```
